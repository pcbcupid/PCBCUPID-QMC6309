# Code of Conduct & Contributing Guidelines

**PCBCUPID Team**  
**_Last update : July 4th 2025_**

We believe in the power of open source collaboration and are grateful for the vibrant community that makes projects like ours possible. Git and GitHub have revolutionized how we build software together, and we're excited to be part of this ecosystem that enables developers worldwide to collaborate and innovate.

## Contributing & Bug Reports

We are always interested in contributions from the community and highly value well-documented bug reports. Your participation helps make our projects better for everyone.

### Submitting Quality Bug Reports

When reporting issues to our repositories, please follow these guidelines to help us address problems efficiently:

- **Use the appropriate repository** for your specific issue
- **Provide a clear, concise description** of the problem you're experiencing
- **Include a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example** (see sscce.org for more details)
- **Ensure the issue is reproducible** with minimal hardware requirements
- **Minimize external dependencies** - avoid requiring installation of numerous additional libraries
- **Include relevant system information** such as operating system, versions, and hardware details when applicable

We need to be able to reproduce issues efficiently and with minimal setup to address them effectively. The more specific and contained your example, the faster we can identify and resolve the problem.

### Important Guidelines for Issues

**Bug reports should focus exclusively on problems with our code.** While we appreciate that you may be using our libraries and tools in your projects, GitHub issues are not the appropriate venue for general coding assistance or debugging help with your own implementation.

For general programming questions, coding help, or project-specific guidance, please use our [community forums](https://forum.pcbcupid.com/).

This policy helps us maintain focus on improving our codebase while ensuring community support channels remain available for broader assistance.

## Community Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, maintainers, and community leaders pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This commitment extends to all community members regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level or type of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all community members. We believe that diverse perspectives and inclusive collaboration lead to better software and stronger communities.

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

- Being kind and courteous to others in all interactions
- Using welcoming and inclusive language that makes everyone feel valued
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds
- Collaborating effectively with other community members
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- Showing empathy towards other community members and their perspectives
- Offering constructive help and guidance to newcomers
- Celebrating the contributions and achievements of others
- Maintaining professionalism in all community interactions

**Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- The use of inappropriate images, including in community member avatars or profiles
- The use of inappropriate language, including in community member nicknames or usernames
- Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
- Excessive or unwelcome helping that goes beyond the scope of questions asked
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Sustained disruption of community discussions or events
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting

### Reporting and Enforcement

We take violations of our community standards seriously and are committed to swift, fair resolution of issues.

**If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, you may report it through the following channels:**

- **Email**: [hello@pcbcupid.org]
- **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue in the appropriate repository for less sensitive matters

All reports will be handled with discretion. Email and direct message reports will be kept confidential, and we will respect the privacy of reporters as much as possible.

**Enforcement Process:**

We follow these steps for upholding our community's standards of conduct:

1. **Investigation**: Any member of the community may report violations of the PCBCUPID Community Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and thoroughly.

2. **Immediate Action for Serious Violations**: If behavior represents an egregious violation, poses immediate harm, or clearly violates platform terms of service, the community member who committed the violation may be banned immediately, without prior warning.

3. **Warning System**: For most violations, moderators will first respond with a clear warning explaining the problematic behavior and expected changes.

4. **Three Strikes Policy**: We follow a soft "three strikes" approach - community members may be given additional chances if they are receptive to warnings and demonstrate genuine effort to change their behavior.

5. **Progressive Consequences**: If a community member is unreceptive, unreasonable when warned by moderators, or continues problematic behavior after warnings, they may be temporarily or permanently banned. Repeated offenses will result in permanent removal from community spaces.

6. **Appeals Process**: Community members may appeal enforcement decisions by contacting project leadership directly.

### Scope and Application

This Code of Conduct and the enforcement policies listed above apply comprehensively to all PCBCUPID Community venues and interactions. This includes but is not limited to:

- All PCBCUPID GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, wikis)
- Any community spaces, both public and private
- Official PCBCUPID communication channels (forums,groups etc.)
- Community meet-ups, conferences, and events
- Social media interactions when representing PCBCUPID
- Email communications related to project business

**Public Representation**: This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. As a community member, you are representing our values and community standards, and are expected to behave accordingly even outside our direct platforms.

**Cross-Platform Consistency**: We expect consistent behavior across all platforms and reserve the right to take action based on behavior in any relevant community space.

### Attribution and Adaptation

For other projects adopting the PCBCUPID Community Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement policies. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.
